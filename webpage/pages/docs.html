<h1 id="picotracker-manual-wip-">picoTracker Manual (WIP)</h1>
<h2 id="project-folders">Project folders</h2>
<p>Project folders use the <code>lgpt</code> prefix, any folder with such a prefix will be treated as a project and it&#39;s project config file (if it exists) will be read. Projects in subfolders are supported but subfolders cannot be currently created within picoTracker. picoTracker will create all projects at the root of the SD card.</p>
<p>picoTracker cannot directly load lgpt files because it doesn&#39;t support all the chains/phrases/tables/instruments as lgpt does and loading the files directly would cause a crash.</p>
<h2 id="importing-lgpt-projects">Importing LGPT projects</h2>
<p>Under the <code>util</code> folder there is a command line tool named <code>lgptconvert.py</code> that can be used to convert lgpt projects into picoTracker. This tool is pretty inneficient, it&#39;s code is ugly and written pretty lazily, but it <em>should</em> work for most projects. If the number of chains/phrases/tables/instruments in the original project doesn&#39;t fit picoTracker, it will not output a result (the tool will not verify the size of the <code>samples</code> directory). Otherwise an XML project file will be written to STDOUT. Output can be redirected to a file of your choice, but make sure that the resulting file is named <code>lgptsav.dat</code>.</p>
<p><code>util % python3 lgptconvert.py lgptsav.dat</code></p>
<h2 id="importing-samples">Importing Samples</h2>
<p>picoTracker copies samples from the SD card into Flash memory for playing, this limits the amount of samples space to the available flash space <em>minus</em> the space taken by the firmware itself, which is currently approximately 1MB. It supports 8 or 16 Bit wav files, any sampling frequency, mono or stereo. 8bit samples are converted to 16bit at load time for compatibility with the engine (you can save space in storage but not in RAM, keep this in mind when choosing samples).</p>
<p>Samples are saved into a <code>samples</code> subfolder in each individual project folder. Samples will be placed there when importing using the Instrument Sample Import dialog. They could be copied manually into the project directory in the SD from a computer, but be mindfull of the storage space used, all samples in the <code>samples</code> directory of the project will be loaded upon project loading, whether they are assigned to an instrument or not. The safest way is to place any samples into the <code>samplelib</code> directory and then load them into projects from the UI.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Please be aware that due to a temporary issue with the current picoTracker firmware and limited RAM available, there is a <strong>limit</strong> of 25 sample files per subdirectory inside <code>samplelib</code>. Filenames are also temporarily limited to a maximum of 32 ASCII characters.</p>
<h3 id="samplelib">samplelib</h3>
<p>The <code>samplelib</code> folder at the root of the SD card is where picoTracker will look samples to import into projects. You can place as many samples as you&#39;d like here and in any directory hierarchy. Samples can be previewed before importing into projects.</p>
<h2 id="config-xml">config.xml</h2>
<p>A <code>config.xml</code> file can be placed on the root of the SD card. The only configuration options right now are the interface colors and setting the keymap &quot;style&quot;. </p>
<p>This is an example config file:</p>

<h2 id="updating-firmware">Updating firmware</h2>
<p>You&#39;ll need to do this while powering the picoTracker via a USB connected to a PC. From the project menu select <code>Update firmware</code>. This will reboot the device into <em>BOOTSEL</em> mode, and you&#39;ll see the pico as a USB mass storage device. Just copy the UF2 firmware file into it.</p>
<h2 id="shutdown">Shutdown</h2>
<p>You can just unplug the machine any time you want other than when saving a project (which is an extremely brief moment). Save your work first if you care about it.</p>

<li>The top of the song screen displays if you are in SONG or LIVE mode (toggle with B+LT or B+RT) and the name of the project you are editing.</li>
<li>On the bottom of the screen is the play-time visualizer. Each box correlates with the above columns in the song grid. When a sample is triggered in one of the columns, the note value of that trigger is displayed in the play-time visualizer.</li>
<li>On the top right of the song screen we have some more play-time statistics. First there is the clip indicator which displays “—---” when your volume levels are ok and “clip” when you&#39;ve cleared the headroom and are chopping off the top of your samples. The bottom row of the play-time statistics is the amount of time which has passed since you pressed Play.</li>
<li>You can make a new chain by hitting A,A on a blank space in the song screen grid.</li>

<li><strong>sample:</strong> selects the .wav file to associate with the instrument. you can select the same sample in more than one instrument. if you tap A,A here it will take you to the Sample Import Screen (which lets you load new .WAV into your project).</li>
<li><strong>volume:</strong></li>
<li><strong>pan:</strong> pans the instrument left or right (0x7F is center)</li>
<li><strong>root note</strong></li>
<li><strong>detune</strong></li>
<li><strong>drive:</strong> This is a volume modification before crush, and the instruments volume is after the crush.</li>
<li><strong>crush:</strong> decrease bit resolution</li>
<li><strong>downsample:</strong> decrease the bit rate, get those low frequency aliasing whines. each increase in this value will downsample the original sample by a factor of 2</li>
<li><strong>cutoff:</strong> filter cutoff frequency</li>
<li><strong>reso:</strong> filter resonance frequency</li>
<li><strong>type:</strong> this is where it gets a little trickier. The filter now supports continuous change from low pass to high pass. set type to 00 for low pazz. FF for hi-pass and 7f for Band pass (or is it notch? n0s must check). all intermediate values morph in between them.</li>
<li><p><strong>dist:</strong> filter distortion. for the moment we have none &amp; scream. i&#39;m planning on maybe add a third choice that would make the filter behave a little better when resonance is set very high in the old/default mode</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>interpolation:</strong> Interpolation mode (&#39;linear&#39;/&#39;none&#39;): selects which interpolation mode is used when in between samples. linear interpols linearly while none takes the nearest neighbor. Use none when playing samples at low range to add some typical overtones.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>loop mode:</strong> selects the looping mode.<ul>
<li>none will play sample from zero to end.</li>
<li>loop will start at zero and loop from loopstart to end.</li>
<li>looper sync will automatically tune a loop so that it plays exactly 16 bars. Use the root note to play twice faster/slower</li>
<li>oscillator is a special mode where the loop selection (from loopstart to end) is taken as oscillator data and automatically tuned. Experiment with different settings, do not forget &#39;root note&#39; is your friend to tune the oscillator back in a useful range</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>start:</strong> start point of the sample regardless of if loop is enabled; in hex</li>
<li><strong>loop Start:</strong> start point of the sample when loop is enabled; in hex</li>
<li><strong>loop End:</strong> end point of the sample; in hex. You can play samples backwards by setting the end value lower than the start!</li>
<li><strong>automation:</strong> If On, the table play arrows will advance one row every time the instrument is triggered, and execute only the commands on the new rows. If this is Off, table behavior is normal (play arrows cruise around real fast).</li>
<li><strong>table:</strong> Select a table the instrument will always run. Clone a table here: RT+(B,A). Make a new table here: A,A.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sample-import-screen">Sample Import Screen</h2>
<p>Accessible by hitting A,A on the “sample:” parameter in the Instrument Screen.</p>
<p>All the samples that you may want to import into a project <strong>must</strong> be located in a folder named <code>samplelib</code> at the top-level of the sdcard. You can either put your samples in that directory or in sub-directories of it, allowing you to have a basic way of sorting your samples library. </p>
<p>Note: sub-directories will be sorted before files, but otherwise the files will be listed in an unspecified order (ie. not necessarily alphabetical order).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>TODO: screencap</p>
<p>When entering the import screen, the current folder is the library root folder <code>samplelib</code>. All samples (<code>.wav</code> files) in that folder are listed.</p>
<p>Use Up/Down to select a sample and the Play button to start/stop preview playback of the sample.
LT+Play to import the currently selected sample and RT+Left to exit out of the Import Dialog back to the Instrument Screen.</p>
<p>Note: While there is no fixed limit for the number of files per sub-directory, exceding 96 sub-directories and/or 354 files per directory is likely to cause picotracker to potentially crash. Also please note that while FAT formatted sdcards can support upto <em>256</em> characters per filename, Picotracker only supports upto <strong>128</strong> and with only <strong>ASCII</strong> characters.</p>

<p>A midi instrument has the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Channel</strong> - This can be set 0x80 to 0x8F which is midi channel 1-16 respectively</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong> - The volume any NOTE ON will be sent to your device. FF=127, 00=00</li>
<li><strong>Length</strong> - Sets note gate length in number of ticks.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong> - On, the table play arrows will advance one row every time the instrument is triggered, and execute only the commands on the new rows. If this is Off, table behavior is normal (play arrows cruise around real fast).</li>
<li><strong>Table</strong>- As above, select a table the instrument will always run. Clone a table here: RT+(B,A). Make a new table here: A,A.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="table-screen">Table Screen</h2>
<p>TODO: screencap</p>
<ul>
<li>Hopping to self in table holds the step for x ticks. For example</li>
</ul>
<p>05 HOP 1005
will hold step 5 for 10 ticks. Interesting for example after a VOL command to allow complex envelopes:
00 VOL 0400 ; starts short volume decay to zero 01 HOP 1010 ; holds enough ticks for VOL to complete 02 VOL 0560 ; raise volume to 60 03 HOP 6003 ; hold for a long time to allow VOL to ; complete and hold volume to 60</p>
<ul>
<li>After Hopping count is reached, the table pointer moves directly to the line after</li>
</ul>
<p>the HOP rather than staying on the HOP line for one tick. Makes more sense.</p>
<h2 id="groove-screen">Groove Screen</h2>
<p>TODO: screencap</p>
<p>Groove screen is located on top of the phrase screen. Groove lets you rock some swing to bust funky beats.
To grasp groove you must first you must know what a tick is, and a tick is simply a constant measurement of time. By default, every row of a phrase (aka step) gets 6 ticks, that&#39;s why you see two sixes when you go to the groove screen. But say you change the first 6 to a 1. Now, every other step lasts for 1 tick (which is shorter than 6 ticks).
To get a handle on this, try a groove of 1/F and watch the play arrow in a phrase. You&#39;ll notice the play arrow hanging around on the odd steps longer than the even ones. Then try a groove of 1/1/F and go back to the phrase screen. You&#39;ll see the play arrow hanging on every third step. Once you grasp how the groove screen effects the play arrow, you can move to more subtle values or keep the beat way freaked out!
In the groove screen there is no copy paste (yet) but the following action exists:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Adds a new step if not existing</li>
<li>A+Left/Right: modifies current step value</li>
<li>B+Arrows: modifies current edited groove</li>
<li>B+A: Clear current step</li>
</ul>
<p>the GRV command (only active in the phrase screen) select the current groove</p>
<h1 id="commands">Commands</h1>
<p>There can be two commands on every row of the phrase screen. Commands which effect instruments can be run on any step of the instruments playback, including the step where the instrument is triggered.
in vol; pitch and kill but the definition of the “time&#39; is slightly different for all command…</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="irt-aabb-irtg-in-lgpt-">IRT aabb (IRTG in lgpt)</h2>
<p>IRT stands for Instrument Retrigger and will retrigger the current instrument. It gives table the ability to work as progammable phrases that then can be triggered simply by changing tables.
IRT –bb will retrigger the current instrument transposed by bb semi-tones. Note that each IRT transposition is cumulatively added. So a table with
IRT 0001
will keep going a semi tone up. Great for dubby echoes :)
The retriggered instrument is NOT reset (as if you enter a note with no instrument number). The table (obviously) will continue to run and all running variable (filter,etc) won&#39;t be reset.
This system is also pretty useful to implement temporary non 4/4 signature without having to switch grooves, since you have the ability to re-trigger the instrument at tick resolution
don&#39;t forget trying to combine it with complex hop structure !</p>

<li>if LEG is put on a row where a note is present and the pitch offset is 0 (e.g. <code>C4 I3 LEG 1000</code>) the slide will occur automatically from previous note to the current one at the given speed.</li>
<li>If an instrument is not triggered on the same row as LEG, the command will re-trigger the previous instrument (unless the previous instrument is still playing).</li>
